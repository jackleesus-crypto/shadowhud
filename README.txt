ShadowHUD v12.1 — multi‑file build

Files you should deploy to your GitHub Pages root (or /docs if that’s your Pages folder):
- index.html
- style.css
- app.js
- .nojekyll  (prevents GitHub Pages from rewriting things)
- README.txt (you can omit this)

Fresh install steps:
1) Delete ALL old files from your Pages folder.
2) Upload these files and commit.
3) On iPhone: Settings → Safari → Advanced → Website Data → search your site → Delete.
4) Reload your site. The header should show v12.1. Use the tabs; each screen is isolated.
